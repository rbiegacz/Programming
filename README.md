This repo contains various exercises related to different programming paradigms

WHAT THIS REPO IS ABOUT:

_parallel_ folder contains examples for programs implemented according to CPU, CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP, MPI paradigms.

ASSUMPTIONS:

Assuming that you have Ubuntu machine (specifically, I tested this repo on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit).
Your computer needs to be equppied with GPU (specifically, I tested this repo on NVIDIA TITAN X).
Couple hints:
- Installing MPI on your Ubuntu machine: sudo apt-get install mpi-default-dev
- Installing NVCC on your Ubuntu machine: sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

EXECUTION:

Enter _parallel_ folder and run 'make all' command.
